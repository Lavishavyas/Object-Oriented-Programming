# üß† Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in C++

üìö What is OOP

Object-Oriented Programming is a programming approach based on objects that contain both data (attributes) and functions (methods). It makes code modular, reusable, and easy to maintain.

üß© Core OOP Concepts

1Ô∏è‚É£ Encapsulation  
Encapsulation is the idea of combining data and functions in a single unit called a class. It allows hiding the data and controlling access through public methods.  
Example: A Student class with private age variable and public setAge and getAge methods.

2Ô∏è‚É£ Inheritance  
Inheritance allows a class to acquire properties and methods of another class. It helps in code reusability and represents hierarchical relationships.  
Example: A Dog class inherits from Animal class and can use Animal's methods like eat.

3Ô∏è‚É£ Polymorphism  
Polymorphism means many forms. It allows the same function to behave differently depending on the object.  
Compile-time polymorphism is function or operator overloading.  
Run-time polymorphism is achieved using virtual functions.  
Example: A draw() method that works differently for Shape and Circle classes.

4Ô∏è‚É£ Abstraction  
Abstraction hides implementation details and shows only essential features.  
Example: Abstract class Car with a start() method implemented by BMW class.

üõ†Ô∏è Additional Concepts

Constructors and Destructors: Special functions called when an object is created or destroyed.  
Static Members: Variables or methods shared among all objects of a class.  
Operator Overloading: Defining custom behavior for operators like +, -.  
Friend Functions: Functions that are not part of the class but can access private members.
